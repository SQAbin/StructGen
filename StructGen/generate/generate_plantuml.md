**Context:**

Below is a code requirement describing the functionality and logic to be implemented. Based on the requirement, generate a corresponding optimized PlantUML activity diagram.

---

### Input Content
1. **Code Requirement**:
```python
{dataset_prompt}
```

---

### Guidelines
1. Ensure the activity diagram aligns with the logic in the code requirement:
    - Include all key steps, decision points, and loops described.
2. Clearly define branching conditions and input/output flows:
    - Add validation logic (e.g., input checks, edge case handling).
    - Ensure that start and end conditions are explicitly shown.
3. Structure the activity diagram for clarity:
    - Use logical grouping and hierarchy to enhance readability.
    - Avoid redundancy and ensure concise representation.

**Output Requirement:**

Generate a clear and professional PlantUML activity diagram that accurately reflects the logic of the code requirement.
```plantuml
